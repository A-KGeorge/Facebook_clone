# Facebook_clone
This is a clone of Facebook I made as a side project. I won't be hosting it on any website for copyright reasons.


To start the project, go to the frontend folder, go to the terminal, and type
```
npm start
```

The frontend folder is a react.js project

Go to the Backend folder, go to the terminal, and type 

```
npm run server
```

The backend folder is a node.js project

Be sure to change the variables in the .env files, and the project is good to go.
This is currently a work in progress.
